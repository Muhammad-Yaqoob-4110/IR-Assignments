As a country, Pakistan maintains strong ties with multiple international organisations such as SAARC, OIC, and the United Nations. Being part of these organisations allows Pakistan to engage with other countries and address global challenges through an international platform. These international links are crucial for maintaining peace, promoting trade, and solving problems that may impact the country on a larger scale.
