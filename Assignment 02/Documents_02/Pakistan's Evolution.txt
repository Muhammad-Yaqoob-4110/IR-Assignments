Pakistan has a rich history that dates back thousands of years, with historical sites spread across the country. Ancient civilisations like the Indus Valley and Gandhara thrived here, leaving behind important archaeological discoveries. Today, Pakistan has become a more modern country. Cities like Islamabad, the capital, showcase this transformation with new buildings, schools, universities, hospitals, marketplaces, and other essential services. The development of transportation systems, including railways, roads, airports, and seaports, also makes daily life convenient for people across the country.
